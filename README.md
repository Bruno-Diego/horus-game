## Introduction

Welcome to Horus, a fun and addictive game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird! Horus is a JavaScript-based game that challenges your hand-eye coordination and reflexes.

In this game, you take on the role of a bird named Horus, who must navigate through a series of obstacles to reach the end of each level. With each obstacle you pass, you score points and move closer to victory. However, beware of the obstacles that lie ahead, as even the slightest touch can send you crashing to the ground.

With simple one-touch controls, Horus is easy to play but difficult to master. The game features smooth and colorful graphics, an engaging soundtrack, and progressively challenging levels that will keep you coming back for more.

Are you ready to take on the challenge of Horus and see how far you can go? Let's flap those wings and take to the skies!


In this website, the technologies I've used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

The development of this website was greatly inspired by the Udemy's course [Web Moderno](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-web/) provided by Leonardo Moura Leitao and Cod3r Courses to whom I send a huge thanks.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
